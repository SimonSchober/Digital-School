        <p>
            Hello and welcome to River, My name is Simon Schober and I am the developer of this amazing website. I love
            programming, especially with HTML, CSS or Bootstrap. I also started programming this website with these 3
            programming languages.
            Please send feedback or inquiries to this e-mail:
            river@company.com

            STORY
        </h1>

        <p>
            The website River was started on the 12th March 2023. The story of this website is basically quite simple,
            on Sunday (the 13th) I was a bit sick so I was at home too, and because I was bored I went to my laptop,
            opened my programming program and wanted to program a website, but what should it be called? first i asked
            my chatbot and he says the name nexus but nexus already existed so i researched the internet and found a
            perfect name! RIVER with the motto "Like a Wave" it was perfect and that's how this website was created.
        </p>
